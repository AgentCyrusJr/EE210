Here is the instructions on how to run the code without mistakes.

In this project, we conducted two classification tasks for test, which is both included in this package. 

In the first task, we used MNIST as our dataset, which is under the path'~/EE210_MNIST_New/'. To run the code, you simply run TestMain.m under Command Window line, and it will display the results and figures. 

In the second task, which is image classfication task. The whole project is under the path'~EE210_ImageClass_New/'. To run the code smoothly, the image packages should be included under this path correctly. This time, you should run image_classification.m under the Command Window line, and the results will come out properly.

During the whole test, there should not be any mistakes, if any, please contact xiyuanjiang@ucla.edu.
